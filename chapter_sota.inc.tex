\epigraph{\enquote{The perception of depth in a monocular picture is based completely upon the assumptions of the observer.}}{\emph{Lawrence Roberts}}

This chapter provides an overview of the methods that researchers developed for tackling the single image depth estimation problem.
The developed approaches are so many that it is not feasible to faithfully report all of them.
I'll try to do my best to account for the variety of ideas that scientists come up with for solving the task.
Though, there are many other works that I am aware of but chose not to review.

The chapter is divided into the following sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Regression Methods \ref{s:regression_methods}}
    \item{Bin Methods \ref{s:bin_methods}}
    \item{Self Supervised Methods \ref{s:ssl}}
    \item{Classics}
\end{enumerate}
